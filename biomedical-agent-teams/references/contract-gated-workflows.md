# Contract-Shaped And Validator-Enforced Workflows

Use this reference for `deep`, `audit`, omics `run`, translational, manuscript,
and long-running biomedical workflows.

## Purpose

BMAT role prompts are usually read and applied inline by the runtime. Contract gating
is a policy target, not an automatic runtime guarantee. Without
`scripts/bmat_validate.py`, BMAT workflows are contract-described: the lead
preserves each role's scope, inputs, methods, findings, limitations, handoff,
and verdict before the final writer synthesizes the answer. With a complete
artifact bundle and a passing validator run, the same workflow can be described
as validator-enforced for the checked policies.

Use `Full protocol followed` only when mandatory artifacts exist, required
gates pass or pass with caveats, post-write validation is not blocked, and
independent review is backed by a spawned subagent, separate model,
tool-backed validator, external verifier, human reviewer, or tool-corroborated
external database/API check.

## Required Flow

1. Produce runtime capability preflight before external source expansion, file
   writes, code execution, spawned-agent claims, or final writing.
2. Produce the workflow preflight contract before external source expansion,
   file writes, code execution, or final writing.
3. Lock source corpus identity, retrieval date/version, inclusion status, and
   claim use before source-backed final wording.
4. For audit/reviewer roles, emit evaluation criteria before reviewing the final
   answer or deliverable when feasible. Keep the criteria separate from the
   content-visible verdict.
5. Store or summarize role outputs using `contracts/role-output.schema.json`.
6. Maintain workflow-run state for deep, audit, omics run, translational,
   generated-file, manuscript-support, or long-running work.
7. Maintain the central claim ledger. The final writer may use only
   `allowed_final_wording` from passed or pass-with-caveats claims.
8. For omics run/audit or long-running generated-file workflows, run S1-S5 stage
   evaluation. If S3 Validate does not pass, S4/S5 claims must be blocked,
   downgraded, or labeled exploratory/not assessable.
9. Apply `references/independent-review-policy.md` before using independent
   validation or independent audit wording.
10. Run post-write validation against `contracts/post-write-validation.schema.json`.
11. For omics `run`, record at least one core spawned or tool-backed reviewer
   after S1-S3 locks, or record the explicit runtime/privacy/user-compact
   downgrade reason for skipping it.
12. Run `scripts/bmat_validate.py` for durable artifact bundles before claiming
   `Full protocol followed`.
13. Downgrade the workflow label when any required gate is skipped, only
   considered informally, or not validator-checked.

## Checkpoint Types

| checkpoint | required before | block condition |
|---|---|---|
| runtime capability lock | tool-backed or full-depth claims | required runtime capability unavailable |
| context lock | source expansion or analysis | unclear question, unsafe scope, or missing human gate |
| source lock | source-backed claims | missing PMID/DOI/accession/version/retrieval date when needed |
| analysis lock | omics/statistics run | missing sample sheet, biological unit, endpoint, or design formula |
| validation stage lock | omics inference or generated-file reporting | S3 validation failed or was not run when required |
| claim lock | final writing | unchecked central claim ledger |
| integrity gate | high-confidence release | unsupported claim, citation mismatch, provenance gap, unsafe advice |

## Validator-Friendly Output

When returning a formal role output, prefer this compact shape:

```text
role:
task_scope:
inputs_checked:
methods_or_tools_used:
key_findings:
limitations:
handoff:
verdict:
```

If the answer is short and interactive, this can be compressed into prose, but
the final workflow label must say `Compact standard workflow` or
`Partial workflow; formal gates skipped` rather than full protocol compliance.
