# Research Overview Template

Use this as the one-page BMAT synthesis after meta-review, results integration,
and ledger update. The overview is a reader-facing summary, not a new analysis
surface.

Do not introduce new claims in the overview. Use only the central claim ledger,
source corpus, results integration rows, workflow-run state, and meta-review
notes. If those surfaces are missing, mark the field as unknown, partial, or
downgraded rather than inferring.

## One-Page Overview

| Team DAG or reviewer lanes used |  |
| Next experiment, analysis, or audit step |  |

## Claim-Trace Table

| overview_statement | claim_ids | source_refs | result_rows | meta_review_note | confidence | limitation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Output Discipline

- Keep the overview short enough to be pasted into a final answer.
- Prefer concrete claim IDs, source IDs, and result row IDs over narrative
  assertions.
- Exclude material that is plausible but absent from the ledger.
- State unresolved contradictions and source gaps explicitly.
- Do not upgrade the workflow label beyond the validator, reviewer, source, and
  runtime capability evidence.
